        <h1>Where it all began...</h1>
        <h2>born in the wonderful country Germany,</h2>
        <p class="beginning">I started my career as an Engineer from a very young age. Being curious all the time and
            trying to understand the world and everything in it, my spare time was always spent building things with
            sticks, stones and ropes. My first ever success as an Engineer was when I build a bow with the help of my
            father. After I felt the pleasure of completing successfully my first project, I continued working on bigger
            and more time-consuming projects. In a group of 5 we found a place in the woods, started to collect
            materials and tools together and build our own treehouse.</p>

                the moment I just thought my engineering career was at its peak, my father taught me differently.
                My father surprised me with a laptop, to help me study and discover the worldwide web. Of course, I did
                not know how to use it at all, so my cousin came over and taught me everything to get started. The first
                time checked images on Google, watched videos on Youtube, and played games on the internet. I soon
                started my next step to become a better engineer.

            <p class="about-paragraphs">
                Yes, that's right, my next step towards a better engineer was gaming. My cousin introduced me to several
                shooter and role play games and I was fascinated. In the beginning, it was nothing more than just
                gaming, but towards the end, it was entering a whole new world of mathematics, logic, and physics...
                <br> <br>
                After I made the decision that I would like to bring out my own game, I started thinking deeply, about how
                games are created. I mean, how do people do that? I started making my research, but could not 
                find anything. Probably because of me asking the wrong questions at that time. Anyway, I was 
                having fun playing a specific role-playing game, and I still wanted to bring out my own game. So I just
                downloaded the server files, made changes to the server files, and linked it to a Hamachi server I created
                (Step by step guides on YouTube). I was gaming for a long time...

            <p class="about-paragraphs">
                A long time has passed, and I am now standing in front of my teachers ready to ask them for advice. Advice
                for what? I want to travel to the UK and improve my English skills, but I don't know where to start. I
                did all the preparation needed to travel to the UK. I decided to
                work as an Au-pair whilst visiting a school to improve my language skills.
                <br> <br>

                I landed, was introduced to the city, the family, the culture, and my new environment. After
                approximately three months of working with the family, we agreed that the family does not necessarily need
                an Au-Pair, so I moved on. As I still wanted to achieve my goal and improve my language skills, I wanted
                to continue visiting the school I was going to. I needed a new place to stay and a new place to work. A
                friend of mine introduced me to someone who owns a kebab shop, I talked to him about my goals and my
                current situation and he did not hesitate long. I found a place for me to stay, taught me everything
                from scratch to work in his shop and I still visited the school.

            <p class="about-paragraphs">
                I finished school and it was time to use my English skills in something I indirectly always wanted to
                learn. While still working full-time in the kebab shop, I used my spare time learning about different
                programming languages. In the beginning, I just started finding out, the differences between all the languages
                and what they are used for. I told a friend of mine about the idea that I want to learn to program and
                he showed me different platforms where they teach it.
                <br> <br>

                I opened W3Schools, went through the documentation of JavaScript, and tried to understand a word. The
                image you saw above represents what my brain looked like when I read it. It was extremely difficult for
                me to understand how JavaScript works and how to apply it properly. I was going through the exercises
                step by step, and within one year I completed several projects <a href="projects.html"

                I was not a master of JavaScript, but I could not wait to learn another language. It was
                not just web development I was interested in, it was also artificial intelligence, cyber security and
                machine learning.
                I found out that Python was the language that developers would use for these. So I started taking a
                course on Udemy, where I learned about the syntax of Python and how to use the language properly. I
                completed projects with Python like a Blackjack game or a Ceasar Cipher program that allows you to
                encode/decode a string. <a

            <p class="about-paragraphs">
                After studying approximately two years of programming languages, I finally decided to make it to my
                career. I learned a lot during my time in the kebab shop. From customer service, communication,
                discipline, to food preparation. I started looking for Software Development
                Apprenticeships to gain my level 4 certificate and to become a qualified Software Developer. I was
                having a hard time finding Apprenticeships, so I asked a friend of mine (Software Developer and Tutor at
                University)for help and he introduced me to a company called Generation UK. Generation UK is a technical
                boot camp where I intensively learned the skills to become a successful Software Development Apprentice.
                The GenerationBootcamp specifically prepared several students for a Level 4 Apprenticeship in Software
                Engineering.
                <br> <br>

                I have many goals, including short-term and long-term goals. My current short-term goals are to get
                successfully into Software Development/Engineering Apprenticeship, gain my level 4 certificate and
                expand my knowledge in frontend as well as backend development.
                Besides that, I am constantly working on my personal development by studying courses on LinkedIn
                Learning, Udemy and YouTube. I am also going through my completed projects, to refactor and simplify my
                code. My very long-term goal is to write a cyber security software in a team to prevent hackers from
                gaining access into systems. Thank you for going through my About page. I
